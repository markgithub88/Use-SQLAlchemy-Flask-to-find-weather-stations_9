OVERVIEW.  Understanding the trends in the weather data for Oahu for the purpose of opening an ice cream shop sustainable year-round.

PURPOSE. We question whether or not the temperatures and precipitation in Oahu will hamper ice cream business year-round. We are comparing June and December.

RESULTS.
1.  The June and December temperatures do not vary more than three or four degrees indicating that temperature probably will not be a deciding factor.
2.  The minimum temperature in December is a little colder. This may warrant a short shutdown of the business
3. Application in the year of 2017 very greatly but the average rainfall should not affect the business.

SUMMARY.  The weather seems quite stable in this area. If however other ideas might be entertained maybe thinking about the leeward side of the island might be worthwhile because of the sunshine.
